          You are eligible for a new Medicare program that enables us to provide
          you with around-theclock service to oversee your chronic conditions
          and improve your overall wellness. Chronic conditions are ongoing
          medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia, heart
          disease, depression, osteoporosis, and many others. These conditions
          must be managed effectively in partnership between the healthcare team
          and patient to maintain the best possible overall health and wellness.
          CCM Services are available to you because you have been diagnosed with
          two (2) or more chronic conditions which are expected to last at least
          twelve (12) months and which place you at significant risk of further
          decline.

          Medicare will allow us to bill approximately $42 for these services
          during any month that we have provided at least 20 minutes of
          non-face-to-face chronic care management services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medicare will reimburse us approximately $32 and requires you to pay
          approximately $8 to $9 (your Medicare coinsurance amount, may be
          covered by your secondary insurance) each month that you receive at
          least 20 minutes of chronic care management. Our office will have the
          record of when and how the 20 minutes were spent and you will have
          24/7 access to your electronic medical record if you ever have
          questions. Our practice is compliant with HIPAA and all laws related
          to the privacy and security of Protected Health Information (PHI). As
          a part of this program, your PHI may be shared between caregivers
          directly involved with your health.

          please ask any of our staff members for the CCM termination form. The
          provider will continue providing CCM services until the end of the
          month and may bill Medicare for those services. After the end of the
          month, the provider will discontinue CCM services and no longer bill
          for those services to Medicare.
